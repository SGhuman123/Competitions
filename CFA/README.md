# About

In the CFA competition which my friends and I took part in to form a team of 4, we were tasked to assess whether we should buy a stock and we were provided the options which were IHH or Grab. My team eventually chose to evaluate Grab and during the competition, I learnt how to read annual reports effectively as well as how to utilise other financial resources such as the Bloomberg terminal at my disposal. We first made it past the school round and my team eventually got the chance to be chosen to represent the school and took part in the national round against all the other universities in Singapore.
